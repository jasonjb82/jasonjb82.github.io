<p>I love working with data, both spatial and non-spatial and being able to see the various nuances that
exist in it. I strive to help to help individuals, organizations and communities by analysing data and
producing visualizations that would help them gain better insights and make better decisions.</p>

<p>I grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipoh/">Ipoh</a>,
a former tin mining town in nothern Peninsular Malaysia. It is one of those towns
with a small-city feel with big city values. Constantly enchanted with majestic abrupt limestone hills clad
with sparse vegetation, honeycombed with caves rising out of plains with patches of calm but deep waterbodies,
I grew to love nature and the outdoors.</p>

<p>I decided to further my studies in Remote Sensing, which is a very data rich field and thoroughly enjoyed
working with a wide range of datasets. This is where I got to combine my passion for the environment and also
my love for computers and technology.</p>

<p>After spending 5 years in Malaysia and building up my geospatial skills, I moved to Adelaide, South Australia
to continue to develop my skills and competencies working on a wide range of multi-disciplinary projects.</p>

<p>In mid-2013, I moved back to Malaysia was based at a research organization that helped my develop my
non-spatial data analytical and visualization skills using R. I have since been very actively developing
my skills in R by utilizing it as much as possible in various roles. I also work on various personal projects
using R to produce visualizations using open and publicly available datasets.

<p>I am currently helping the organization I am part off to better manage, analyse and visualize data that
will hopefully lead to improved sustainable practises in businesses. I also volunteer with a local conservation
NGO with my GIS and mapping skills to help lobby for the protection of forests and wildlife habitats that are
increasingly becoming vulnerable due to infrastructure development and cash crop expansion.</p>
