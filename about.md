<p>I love working with data, both spatial and non-spatial and being able to see the various nuances that
exist in it. I strive to help individuals, organizations and communities by analysing data and
producing visualizations that would help them gain better insights and make better decisions.</p>

<p>I grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipoh/">Ipoh</a>,
a former tin mining town in northern Peninsular Malaysia. Constantly enchanted with majestic abrupt limestone
hills clad with sparse vegetation, honeycombed with caves rising out of plains with patches of calm but deep waterbodies,
I grew to love nature and the outdoors.</p>

<p>My background is in Remote Sensing and I have spent the last 13 years working in various technical and coordinating roles
in the geospatial field with service providers, consultancies and NGO's.</p>

<p>I am particularly keen on using geospatial technologies and data science to map and better understand environmental and social issues that exist in commodity supply chains such as deforestation and human rights abuses.</p>

<p>Most recently, I have moved into the space of data analytics and visualization to couple with my proficiency in cartography and mapping with the aim of developing more effective visualizations like dashboards and data infographics.</p>

<p>My hope is that this can provide data guided intelligence and actionable insights to help communities, the environment and businesses co-exist and thrive in a more sustainable world.</p>
