<p>I love working with data, both spatial and non-spatial and being able to see the various nuances that
exist in it. I strive to help individuals, organizations and communities by analysing data and
producing visualizations that would help them gain better insights and make better decisions.</p>

<p>I grew up in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipoh/">Ipoh</a>,
a former tin mining town in northern Peninsular Malaysia. Constantly enchanted with majestic abrupt limestone
hills clad with sparse vegetation, honeycombed with caves rising out of plains with patches of calm but deep waterbodies,
I grew to love nature and the outdoors.</p>

<p>My background is in Remote Sensing and I have spent the last 14 years working in various technical and coordinating roles
in the geospatial field with service providers, consultancies and NGO's.</p>

In the last 4 years, I have increasingly used the R language for both spatial and non-spatial data analysis and visualization.
Recently, I have started using R to produce visualizations using publicly available datasets in an attempt to promote
the use of open source tools and open datasets, particularly in Malaysia where the availablity of open data is still very scarce.

<p>I am currently helping the organization I am part off to better manage, analyse and visualize data that
will hopefully lead to improved sustainable practises in businesses. I also volunteer with a local conservation
NGO with my GIS skills to help lobby for the protection of forests and wildlife habitats that are
increasingly becoming vulnerable due to infrastructure development and cash crop expansion.</p> 

<p>I am open to pro-bono, volunteering, paid consultancy work or to collaborate on any mapping, data analysis or visualization project
that would levarage on my skills and passion for working with data. Please free free to contact me for any enquiries.</P
