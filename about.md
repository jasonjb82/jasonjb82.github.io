<p>I love working with data, both spatial and non-spatial and being able to see the various nuances that
exist in it. I strive to help to help individuals, organizations and communities by analysing data and
producing visualizations that would help them gain better insights and better decisions.</p>

<p>I grew up in Ipoh, a small former tin mining town in nothern Peninsular Malaysia. It is of those towns
with a small-city feel with big city values. Surrounded with majestic limestone hills clad with sparse
vegetation overlooking huge plains with patches of calm but deep mining pools and lakes, I had always loved
the outdoors and nature.</p>

<p>I decided to pursue my studies in Remote Sensing, which is a very data rich field and thoroughly enjoyed
working with a wide range of datasets. This is where I got to combine my passion for the environment and also
my love for computers and technology.</p>

<p>After spending 5 years in Malaysia and building up my geospatial skills, I managed to secure a move
to Adelaide,South Australia to continue to develop my skills and competencies on a wide range of multi-disciplinary
projects.</p>

<p>In mid-2013, I moved back to Malaysia was based at a research organization that helped my develop my
non-spatial data analytical and visualization skills using R. I have since been very actively developing
my skills in R by utilizing it as much as possible in various roles. I also work on various personal projects
using R, mainly to develop visualizations using open and publicly available datasets.

<p>I am currently helping the organization I am part off to better manage, analyse and visualize data that
will hopefully lead to reducing deforestation and improving sustainable practises in businesses. I also
volunteer with a local conservation NGO with my GIS and mapping skills to help lobby for the protection of
forests and wildlife habitats that are increasingly becoming vulnerable due to infrastructure development
and cash crop expansion.</p>
